## Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** [AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020)  
- Contains sensor readings and operational data from milling machines.  
## Models Implemented

Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Random Forest Classifier** – Handles nonlinear relationships well and provides feature importance.  
2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier** – Boosting approach for improved predictive accuracy.  
3. **Logastic Regression** – Effective for high-dimensional datasets and classification tasks.  

> All models are compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
